#Day 6
  Initially we start again our day with some questions based on the CPU 
a built-in tool that allows administrators to view information about users that are currently logged in such as System Uptime, number of Users, JCPU, IDLE, PCPU etc
the advance command of 'w' is loginctl which will rovide you more options and better interface
later we disccused about the background process while the OS is starting, 
so there are several steps include with them 
1. starting with BIOS 
2. GRUB - who update the MBR(master Boot Recorder) 
3. The kernel : the heart of OS
4. initrd/ systemd : which is the first process to start the all other process same as we kicked to a bike for starting 
5. Mounting the root file system 
6. GRUB in the action : master of Multiple Boot
and the all process is known as the BOOTING PROCESS!

you can t use the direct the partition without mount them
later we clear our concept of GRUB, Kernel and systemd/initrd files process, how they are working
