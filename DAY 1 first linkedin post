🚀 Excited to kickstart my DevOps Training journey at LinuxWorld Institute, under the guidance of our mentor Mr. Vimal Daga Sir! 🙌

Today’s session was packed with hands-on learning and practical insights into the world of DevOps:

🌟 Four Methods to Install Operating Systems
1️⃣ Bare Metal:
High-performance option, but limited to one system at a time.

2️⃣ Virtualization:
Leveraging tools like Oracle VirtualBox, VMware, and Hyper-V for multi-system setups.

3️⃣ Cloud Computing:
Exploring AWS, Azure, and GCP to build scalable environments.

4️⃣ Containerization:
Using Docker and Kubernetes for lightweight, portable, and efficient solutions.

🖥️ Essential Commands & System Insights
Understanding Commands:

Use man [command] to explore all the available options for any command. For example, man date provides detailed options for the date command.
Monitoring System Resources:

Continuously track CPU and memory usage with top and htop.
Modify program priorities with nice and renice.
Identify the Resident Address (RES) to measure how much memory a program is using.
Managing Processes:

Pause a process: Ctrl + Z
Resume a paused process: fg [job ID]
View running jobs: jobs
Terminate processes: Use kill -9 [PID] or directly kill from the top status.
🖋️ Introduction to Bash Shell Scripting
Revised key concepts like shell variables, reading user inputs, and storing command outputs in variables for later use.
Explored the power of & to execute multiple commands simultaneously.
Learned how to edit and manage scripts efficiently using tools like gedit.
Each of these learnings emphasized the importance of having a solid grasp of the underlying systems that support modern DevOps workflows.

A big shoutout to LinuxWorld Institute for fostering such a dynamic and hands-on learning environment. The journey ahead is exciting, and I can’t wait to dive deeper!
