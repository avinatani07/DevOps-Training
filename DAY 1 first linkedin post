🚀 Excited to kickstart my DevOps Training journey at LinuxWorld Institute, under the guidance of our mentor Mr. Vimal Daga Sir! 🙌

Today, we dived into some foundational yet impactful concepts and practical hands-on learning:

🌟 Four Methods to Install Operating Systems
1️⃣ Bare Metal:
High-performance option, but limited to one system at a time.

2️⃣ Virtualization:
Leveraging tools like Oracle VirtualBox, VMware, and Hyper-V for multi-system setups.

3️⃣ Cloud Computing:
Exploring AWS, Azure, and GCP to build scalable environments.

4️⃣ Containerization:
Using Docker and Kubernetes for lightweight, portable, and efficient solutions.

🖥️ Essential Commands & Insights
Managing Processes:

Pause a process: Ctrl + Z
Resume a paused process: fg [job ID]
View running jobs: jobs
Monitoring System Resources:

Analyze CPU and RAM usage with ps -aux.
Identify specific process IDs using pgrep [process name].
Terminate processes gracefully or forcefully with kill -9 [PID].
This session reinforced the importance of understanding the underlying systems that power modern DevOps workflows.

A big shoutout to LinuxWorld Institute for creating such a hands-on and practical learning environment. I’m excited to explore the limitless possibilities DevOps has to offer in transforming IT landscapes!
