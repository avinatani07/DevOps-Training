The operating system is the foundation of any computer system – the invisible hand orchestrates everything from running applications to managing hardware.

There are four primary ways to install an OS:

1) Bare Metal: 🖥️ The traditional approach. The OS is installed directly onto the physical hardware. This provides maximum control and performance but can be time-consuming to set up and manage.

2) Virtualization: ☁️ Multiple virtual machines (VMs) run independently on a single physical server. This offers flexibility, resource isolation, and improved hardware utilization, but it can introduce a slight performance overhead.

3) Cloud Computing: ☁️ The OS runs on virtual servers within a cloud provider's data center. This provides scalability, on-demand resources, and reduced infrastructure costs, but reliance on the cloud provider is a key consideration.

4) Containerization: 📦 Lightweight and portable units that package an application and its dependencies. This enables efficient deployment and scaling of applications across different environments.

Today, let's dive into some fundamental commands that every Linux user should be familiar with:

-> echo: Displays text on the console.

-> man ls: Displays the manual page for a command.

-> pwd: Displays the current working directory.

-> jobs: Displays a list of background jobs currently running.

-> fg: Brings a background job to the foreground.

-> ps: Provides a snapshot of the currently running processes on your system.
        ps aux (Shows all processes)

-> kill: Allows you to terminate running processes.
        kill <process_id> (Sends a signal to the process)
            Important Signals:
                kill -9: Forceful termination (SIGKILL)
                kill -15: Normal termination (SIGTERM) - Default signal for kill
                kill -2: Interrupt (SIGINT) - Often generated by Ctrl+C
                kill -18: Continue (SIGCONT) - Resumes a stopped process
                kill -19: Stop (SIGSTOP) - Stops a process

-> top: Displays real-time system and process activity.

-> grep: Searches for patterns within text files.

-> date: Displays the current date and time.
