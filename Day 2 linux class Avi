Day 2
👉🏻I/O Redirection 
-> Touch command to create a file
-> tr to translate to from given to new one 
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' <enter input>
-> date > file.txt it will enter date into the given file
-> to append in the file ">>" 
-> if we don't have to give input in tr command we can use file as input by using "<" and enter the filename
-> 1GiB=1024 Mib 
-> In pendrive we store data in GiB not in GB 
-> "*" means anything 
-> expr command is used to maths calculation 
-> to multiply we need to write "\*" 
👉🏻Piping

--> date | cut -d" " -f2 
Output- Dec 
Here d is delimitor and f is fieldlimiter
-> Head is used to read top 10 lines
--> head -2 file.txt
-> Tail is used to read last 10 lines 
-> awk command 
-> String interpolate that is whenever there is variable in the line it program will automatically understand about it
-> To retrieve the used memory from free command 
free -m | head -2 | tail -1 | awk '{ print $3}'
To store the the answer in variable 
x=`free -m | head -2 | tail -1 | awk { print 3}`
